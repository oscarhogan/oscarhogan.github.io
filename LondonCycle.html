  <h3>How can London become Europe's greatest large cycling city?</h3>
  <div class="container">
  <p>The benefits of cycling are well established. Both on the individual; Disease risk reduction and
     higher life expectancy - as well as on society; reduced traffic fatilites and lower ambient air pollution.
     Many European cities use segregated cycleway infrastructure to improve the perception 
    of safety around cycling, which is the single biggest impedence to uptake.</p>
  <p>While London has made strides in creating a less hostile environment for cyclists, studies mark a
     divide between those that choose to cycle and those that do not. Demographic differences in tendency to cycle reflect an 
     environment where cycleway planning is often built upon existing usage patterns.</p> 
  <p>How then, does the consideration of a range of needs and desires in the cycleway planning process inform network planning?
    And how can geospatial data analysis be used to help create an active travel environment
    that best reflects the needs of London's diverse population, achieving the cities aspiration of
    becoming a leading cycle city.</p>

 <h3> Multi-Criteria Evaluation </h3>
 <div class="container">
 <p> Understanding where cycleway investment is most prudent neccesitates an understanding of how and why people cycle, and 
    the barriers they face. While not all-encompasing, Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE) provides a framework to consider the role of 
    different factors</p>
 <p> MCE weighs different input criteria on the basis of importance, assigning geographic areas a total value. In the case of cycleway planning, looking
    for locations which best satisify the demands of a diverse potential userbase, informs an inclusive network.</p>
 <p> An adjusted version of the Bicycle Levels of Service (BLoS) which is used to assess the quality of existing infrastructure was developed
 to reflect the needs of user groups, underepresented among cyclists who may hold differing route priorities. For example older adults 
 may value routes with lower maximum gradients whereas female cyclists may prioritise street lighting and visibility.</p>
 <p> The visual below illustrates how a pair of environmental factors can inform a final MCE Value</p>
