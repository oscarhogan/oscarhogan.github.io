  <h3>How can London become Europe's greatest large cycling city?</h3>
  <p>The benefits of cycling are well established. Both on the individual; Disease risk reduction and
     higher life expectancy - and on society at large; reduced traffic fatilites, lower ambient air pollution.</p>
  <p>Many European cities use segregated cycleway infrastrcuture to improve the perception 
    of safety around cycling, the single biggest impedence to uptake.</p>
  <p>While London has made strides in creating a less hostile environment for cyclists, 
    investing heavily in new infrastructure - studies mark a
     divide between that choose to cycle and those that do not. Demographic differences in tendency to cycle reflect an 
     environment where cycleway planning is often built upon existing usage patterns.</p> 
  <p>How then, does the consideration of a range of needs and desires in the cycleway planning process inform network planning 
    and how can Geospatial data analysis be used to help create an active travel environment
    that best reflects the needs of London's diverse population.</p>
